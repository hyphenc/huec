# huec
a c program to control your hue lights

still a WIP

## setup / install

the first time you ```make```, you need to run ```make first``` instead, because it sets some stuff up, otherwise make would fail.

coming soon:
register with your hue bridge using ```./hue -r```, just press the link button on the bridge and run this command shortly after.
